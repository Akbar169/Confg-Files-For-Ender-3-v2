# Confg-Files-For-Ender-3-v2

Please Feel free to Help Me out because I have been struggling with this Ender 3 v2 printer but I always try to find solutions and I have upgraded it so its awesome but having trouble confg it for all to work together properly.

Errors I have seen so far: 
While auto leveling the bed: !! {"code":"key243","msg":"Move out of range: 211.800 229.500 5.000 [0.000]", "values":[211.800, 229.500, 5.000, 0.000]}

When I add: [include timelapse.cfg] I get this error: Include file '/usr/data/printer_data/config/timelapse.cfg' does not exist

I don't know if the Nebula have a manual option to adjust the z offset while my other printer has it but its not a smart nor does it connect to network but Manually adjusting the z offset is great while I hope someone can tell me if the Nebula have this feature (I wish) but its been hard to adjust the z offset and auto leveling not working because it gives the error before ending the last row I have it set to 4 by 4 and once it reaches 3 by 4 it sets off the error on the last row, Please Help!!
